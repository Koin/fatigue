    Neato! We just imported 72 runs. See them for yourself at:

## What you get

This grabs run data from the low-fi Nike+ histories, so while it won't have GPS
maps like Garmin rocks, we'll populate your Garmin history with Nike+ data for:

- Distance
- Calories
- Duration
- Date Run

## Install

    gem install fatigue

## Run (lol, puns)

    $ fatigue

## Can I see your ID

Nike might release a public API at some point in the future (although they'll
probably make you buy their shoes in order to use it). Until then, we can sneak
onto their widget API. You need to find your Nike+ user id, though (numeric ID,
that is; not your login).

To do this, log into your Nike+ account, click on "Runs", and then the long
number right at the end of the URL is just what you need. COPY AND PASTE IT
WITH ALL DUE HASTE.

You'll also need to make sure your runs are public. Click on your face on the
sidebar, go to settings, and share your life away. No need to be modest.
